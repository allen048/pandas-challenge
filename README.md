Written Report (15 points)
To receive all points, the written report presents a cohesive written analysis that:

•	Summarizes the analysis (5 points)
  o	This study showed students who have passed reading and math with an average score of 70 and above. We were also able to calculate the       budget per student and school. Another analysis was being able to display the average reading and math scores.

•	Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)
  o	Bailey High School has the largest population size of 4,976 students and Holden has the smallest population size of 427 students. The       average math scores ranged between 77 and 84, while the average reading score ranged between 80 and 85. These comparisons show that         there is a significant population size between the largest and smallest schools. Also, it shows that reading scores are a little bit        better.
